"""Generic registry machinery for registry-kind bricks.

The ``Registry`` *class* is the only shared machinery — domain-agnostic, copied
into every client as part of kairos_core. Each registry brick owns its OWN
``Registry()`` instance, local to its folder; there is no global plugin
namespace.

Plugins register on import: a brick's ``__init__`` explicitly imports its plugin
modules so the decorators fire and the available impls are deterministic and
visible. Each plugin should DEFER its heavy third-party import into the factory
body, so that importing the brick only registers names cheaply and an unselected
plugin's dependency is never required (a tesseract client never needs the cloud
SDK, even though ``cloud.py`` ships in its engines/ folder).
