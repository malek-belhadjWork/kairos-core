"""kairos_core — the reusable core for building modular "bricks".

A *brick* = a generic ENGINE (core logic, never edited per client) + a CONFIG
(the only client/instance-specific surface). Every engine has the shape
``run(input, config) -> output`` so bricks compose into pipelines.

Two kinds of brick:
  * engine   — one engine, behavior driven entirely by config.
  * registry — a stable interface + a registry of interchangeable plugins;
               config selects the implementation and passes its params.

This package defines *shape*, not behavior. A brand-new brick in any domain
conforms to the convention without changing kairos_core.
